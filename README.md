Assignment 3 for MMC6278


## Issues While Completing Assignment
The biggest issue I had was nesting and mixins. I still don't believe I understand these two all the way, even now. It took me a while to figure it out, and I think it's only because of my resource I was able to.

## Outside Resources
The outside resource I used was my project 1 group assignment. One of my team members put together the less, variables and mixins page. He started to code, so I was able to see how he did the nesting, and replicated that for this assignment. Other than that, everything else was pretty okay. I do love variables though, and I will be implementing them going forward.
